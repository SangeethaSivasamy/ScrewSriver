Nosql:
	 - Not Only SQL
	- NoSQL is a non-relational database management system
	- very large scale of data storing needs (for example Google or Facebook which collects terabits of data every day for their users)
	- No predefined schema 
	- high performance, high availability and scalability
	

Mongodb
-MongoDB is a document database.
- MongoDB is schema less.flexible
- There are no  joins in MongoDB.
-Each database contains collections which in turn contains documents.
-MongoDB allows you to represent hierarchical relationships, to store arrays, and other more complex structures
-all records are not restricted by the same column names and types defined across the entire table
- the documents are stored in a binary JSON (BSON) format
- MongoDB enables horizontal scalability by using a technique called sharding. 
Sharding distributes the data across physical partitions to overcome the hardware limitations. The data is automatically balanced in the clusters.
- It supports replica sets; in other words, a failover mechanism is automatically handled. 
If the primary server goes down, the secondary server becomes the primary automatically, without any human intervention.
- no support for transactions - certain atomic operations are supported, at a single document level
